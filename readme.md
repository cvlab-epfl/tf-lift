# TF-LIFT: Tensorflow Implmentation for Learned Invariant Feature Transform #

## Basic Usage ##

### Setting the environment ###

Python Version : 3
OpenCV Version : 3
CUDA Version: 8.0(later)

You'll need to install the dependencies, something like the following:
(Since all the code are running at python3 setting, so the pip3 is used to install the packages)

```
pip3 install numpy h5py tensorflow tensorflow-gpu

```
We will later provide a requirements.txt for you to use with `pip`.

Also, you need to setup your work directories. Edit the `config.py` for a
convenient default argument setting. See help for more information on what the
configurations do.

### Training ###

`main.py` is the entry point for all your needs. Simply define the task you
want to do, the where to save the results (logs) and the training subtask you
want to perform.

For example, to train the descriptor
```
python main.py --task=train --subtask=desc
```

Note: this will save the logs at `logs/main.py---task=train---subtask=desc`. If
you don't want this behavior, you can also add `--logdir=logs/test` in the
command line argument, for example.

### Testing ###

Testing is even more simple, just provide the input image location, the output
file name, keypoint file name (for ori and desc). For example, the following
command will run the entire pipeline for `image1.jpg`, using the model at `logs/test`.

```
python main.py --task=test --subtask=kp --logdir=logs/test --test_img_file=image1.jpg \
  --test_out_file=image1_kp.txt
python main.py --task=test --subtask=ori --logdir=logs/test --test_img_file=image1.jpg \
  --test_out_file=image1_ori.txt --test_kp_file=image1_kp.txt
python main.py --task=test --subtask=desc --logdir=logs/test --test_img_file=image1.jpg \
  --test_out_file=image1_desc.h5 --test_kp_file=image1_ori.txt
```

Note: when trying to load the model, it will always look for the `joint`
trained model first, and fall back to the subtask it is trying to test for.

## More notes on training ##

### Saving the network ###

When training, the network is automatically saved in the `logdir`. If you don't
set this manually, it defaults to
`logs/{concatenation-of-all-arguments}`. The things that are saved are:

* Tensorflow checkpoint
* Tensorflow graph metadata
* `mean` and `std` used for input data normalization
* best validation loss
* best validation iteration

All these are loaded back when we want to continue.

### Loading the network ###

On all runs, the framework automatically resumes from where it left. In other
words, it will **always** try to load network weights and resume. If the
framework cannot find the expected weights, it will just tell you that it could
not find weights in the expected locations, and **will try to go on its merry
way**. Note that this is something that you want to keep in mind. For example,
if you run the subtask `ori`, with a typo in `logdir` pointing you to a
directory without the pretrained descriptor weights, the framework will simply
try to learn the orientation estimator **with random descriptors**. This is
intended, as this might be something that you actually want to try.

Network loading is performed in the following order, **overwriting** the previously
loaded weights:

1. Loads the pretrained weights, in the **old framework** format, from
   directories defined in `pretrained_{subtask}` in the configuration. **This
   feature is deprecated and should not be used**

2. Loads the pretrained weights, in the **new framework** format, from
   directories defined in `pretrained_{subtask}` in the configuration.

2. Loads the weights from the `logdir`, which is either automatically determined
   by the command line arguments, or can be given manually.
   
## Differences from the original version ##

### Batch normalization ###

In the original version, we did not apply batch normalization. In the new
version, bach normalization is applied to all layers. This significantly
speeds-up the learning process, and makes learning stable. This also eliminates
the need for us to normalize the dataset when training, and we can instead
simply put the data range in a reasonable range, say -1 to 1 and be done with
it. Note that since we do this, we also perform batch normalization on the
input.

### L2-pooling and Spatial subtractive normalization ###

We found that these layers can be replaced with normal relus and spatial
pooling without significant difference. They are removed.
